ðŸ“– Yesterday, I completed some codewars questions.

ðŸ’» Today, I am reviewing random key generation in React and useState.
I learned how you can to come up with a unique value in react. 
```
// Come up with a unique value for this sticker.
          id: crypto.randomUUID(),
```
I also reviewed about lifting state up. 

ðŸŽ¯ Later I will be doing some codewars.
