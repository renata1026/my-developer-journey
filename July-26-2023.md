ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week such as videos and tables.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the HTML prework on Code Academy and reviwing Form validation.

FORM VALIDATION

Matching a Pattern
In addition to checking the length of a text, we could also add a validation to check how the text was provided. For cases when we want user input to follow specific guidelines, we use the pattern attribute and assign it a regular expression, or regex. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that make up a search pattern. If the input matches the regex, the form can be submitted.

Letâ€™s say we wanted to check for a valid credit card number (a 14 to 16 digit number). We could use the regex: [0-9]{14,16} which checks that the user provided only numbers and that they entered at least 14 digits and at most 16 digits.

To add this to a form:

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="payment">Credit Card Number (no spaces):</label>
  <br>
  <input id="payment" name="payment" type="text" required pattern="[0-9]{14,16}">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
``

Letâ€™s quickly recap:

Client-side validations happen in the browser before information is sent to a server.
Adding the required attribute to an input related element will validate that the input field has information in it.
Assigning a value to the min attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable minimum value.
Assigning a value to the max attribute of a number input element will validate an acceptable maximum value.
Assigning a value to the minlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable minimum number of characters.
Assigning a value to the maxlength attribute of a text input element will validate an acceptable maximum number of characters.
Assigning a regex to pattern matches the input to the provided regex.
If validations on a <form> do not pass, the user gets a message explaining why and the <form> cannot be submitted.
These quick checks help ensure that input data is correct and safe for our servers. It also helps give users immediate feedback on what they need to fix instead of having to wait for a server to send back that information.

        <input type="submit" value="Submit">

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to complete the prep work today.
