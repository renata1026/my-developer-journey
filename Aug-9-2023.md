ðŸ’» Yesterday, I reviewed While Loops and For Loops Specs.

ðŸ“– Today, I built another multifunctional web application that performs different tasks based on the user's input 
The application will perform the following tasks:

sum: The app will prompt the users for two numbers and return the sum.
convert: The app will convert minutes into seconds.
low: The app will state if the first number is lower than the second number.
random: The app will give a random number between 0 and the user's specified number.
wordCounter: The app will state how many words are in a sentence.
Bonus:

The application will let the user know if it doesn't recognize a particular input.
randomRange: The app will give a random number between two user specified numbers.


ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to review some Math Methods such as math.random. 

randomRange: The app will give a random number between two user specified numbers.

```
function randomRange() {
  const randomMin = +prompt('Enter the minimum number:');
  const randomMax = +prompt('Enter the maximum number:');
  const ranRange =
    Math.ceil(Math.random() * (randomMax - randomMin)) + randomMin;
  alert(`I have generated the random number: ${ranRange}`);
}
```
Here is a good analogy to understand why to add back randomMin.
magine you have a ruler that goes from 0 to 10, and you want to generate a random number on this ruler. 
But you're not interested in the 0 to 5 part, you want it to start from 5 and go up to 10.

Now, you generate a random fraction, let's say 0.4 (just an example).

This random fraction (0.4) corresponds to a point on the ruler from 0 to 10, which would be 4.

However, you don't want the number 4, you want it to start from 5 and go up to 10.

This is where "shift and adjust" comes in:

Shift: You shift the 4 along the ruler by 5 units (the starting point of your desired range). So, 4 + 5 = 9.

Adjust: Now, 9 falls within your desired range (5 to 10).

In this analogy, "shift and adjust" means taking a point on one part of the ruler and shifting it along the ruler 
to match another part, making sure it falls within the desired range.

In code, it's the same principle: you take a number that's valid within a smaller range, then you add an offset to it (shift) 
to fit it within your desired larger range (adjust). This ensures that the generated number matches your desired range.

``` Reviewed how to capitalize letters using loops

function capitalize() {
  const capitalSentence = prompt(
    'Enter a sentence to capitalize the first letter of each word:'
  );
  let words = capitalSentence.split(' ');

  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
    words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].substr(1);
  }

  const capitalizedSentence = words.join(' '); // Join the words back into a sentence

  alert(`${capitalizedSentence}`);
  return capitalizedSentence;
}
```
