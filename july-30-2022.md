ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did codewars problem solving.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on reviewing React and building a meme generator.

```
.form {
    display: grid;
    grid-template: 40px 40px / 1fr 1fr;
    gap: 17px;
}

.form--input {
    font-family: "Karla", sans-serif;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 1px solid #D5D4D8;
    text-indent: 5px;
}

.form--button {
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
    font-family: "Karla", sans-serif;
    border-radius: 5px;
    background: linear-gradient(90.41deg, #711F8D 1.14%, #A818DA 100%);
    color: white;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
}

-------------------------------
|       40px       |       40px       |
-------------------------------
|        1fr        |        1fr        |
-------------------------------

```
The first row has a height of 40px.
The second row also has a height of 40px.
The first column takes up a fraction of space available 1fr same with the 2nd column.
/ property is used to separate the row sizes from the column sized.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
