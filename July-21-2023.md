Yesterday, I did code war problems and reviewed transposing strings.

📖 Currently, I am learning/working on reviewing JavaScript Alogrithims and Data Structures.

Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire records object.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, you need to update the album's tracks array. First, if the album does not have a tracks property, assign it an empty array. Then add the value as the last item in the album's tracks array.

```
function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) {
  // Access target album in record collection
  const album = records[id];
  // Update the album
  if (value === "") {
    delete album[prop];
  } else if (prop !== "tracks") {
    album[prop] = value;
  } else {
    album["tracks"] = album["tracks"] || [];
    album["tracks"].push(value);
  }
  // Return the full collection
  return records;
}
```
Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.
```
const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now have the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
```
Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.
```
const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0, 2, 4, 6, 8].
```
Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total.
```
// Setup
const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Only change code below this line
let total = 0;
for (let i = 0 ; i < myArr.length ; i++){
  total +=myArr[i]
```
}🎯 My goal is to work on the JavaScript Algorithims and Data Structures on FreeCodeCamp by today
