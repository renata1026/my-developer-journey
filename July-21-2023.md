Yesterday, I did code war problems and reviewed transposing strings.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on reviewing JavaScript Alogrithims and Data Structures.

Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire records object.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, assign the value to that album's prop.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, you need to update the album's tracks array. First, if the album does not have a tracks property, assign it an empty array. Then add the value as the last item in the album's tracks array.

```
function updateRecords(records, id, prop, value) {
  // Access target album in record collection
  const album = records[id];
  // Update the album
  if (value === "") {
    delete album[prop];
  } else if (prop !== "tracks") {
    album[prop] = value;
  } else {
    album["tracks"] = album["tracks"] || [];
    album["tracks"].push(value);
  }
  // Return the full collection
  return records;
}
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to work on the JavaScript Algorithims and Data Structures on FreeCodeCamp by today
