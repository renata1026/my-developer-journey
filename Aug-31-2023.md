ðŸ’» Yesterday, I am working on a project called Spammer POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

You will replicate the functionality of the following website: https://hmh-spammer-frontend.netlify.app/Links to an external site. 
by consuming the following backend API: https://spammer-backend.onrender.com.Links to an external site.
The API docs for this server can be found at: https://github.com/maxdhs/spammer-docsLinks to an external site. 
Specs:

You can see a list of all the messages.
You can post a new message.
You can delete any message.
You can like a message.
You can edit any message.


ðŸ“– Currently, I had a lecture on GIT vs GitHub and will continue to work on the Spammer project. 

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to complete the Spammer Project in the next couple of days.
