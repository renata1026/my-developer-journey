📖 Yesterday, I completed the Joy of React Module 2 - Working with State. I reviewed Event Handlers, Rendering vs. Painting, and Form Binding. 
A re-render is a React process where it figures out what needs to change (AKA. “reconciliation”, the spot-the-differences game).
If something has changed between the two snapshots, React will “commit” those changes by editing the DOM, so that it matches the latest snapshot.
Whenever a DOM node is edited, the browser will re-paint, re-drawing the relevant pixels so that the user sees the correct UI.


💻 Today, I did codewar problems. 
Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.

```
function removeExclamationMarks(s) {
  let result = []
  let array = s.split('')
  for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    if(array[i] !== '!'){
      result.push(array[i])
    }
  }
  return result.join('');
}
```

"CodEWaRs" --> [0,3,4,6]
```
var capitals = function (word) {
let result = [];
  
for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
  if (/[A-Z]/.test(word.charAt(i))){
    result.push(i)
  }
  
}
  return result
};
```
🎯 Later, I will be looking at Next-Auth on App Router
