ðŸ“– Yesterday, I worked with my team member on the backend of our job board app. https://github.com/jobi-job-board/job-board
We also solved a codewars problem togetheon a udemy course called 70+ JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures & Algorithms. 

ðŸ’» Today, I did codewar problems.
Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).
String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

```
function findShort(s){
  let array = s.split(" ")
  let sorted = array.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length);
  return sorted[0].length
}
```

Our football team has finished the championship.

Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point (tie)
We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.

Notes:

```
function points(games) {
  let points = 0;
  for( let i = 0; i< 10; i++){
  let us = games[i].charAt(0)  
  let opponent = games[i].charAt(2)   
  if(us > opponent ){
    points = points + 3
  } else if(us === opponent){
        points++
  }
  }
  return points
}


```

ðŸŽ¯ Later, I will be looking at module 2 of joy of react.
