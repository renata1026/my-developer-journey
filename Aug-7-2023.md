Yesterday, reviewed Javascript basics such as variable, type conversion, string, strict equality, spread, slice, 
not operator, arithimic expressions, math methods, and if statements.

ðŸ“– Currently, we reviewed in our lesson what is javascript, how to add a script tag, and using let or const to declare variables. 
For our assignment I created an ASCII art so people could ask "What animal is this?":

ðŸŽ¯ My goal today is to do Free Code Camps beginner Algorithim questions.
```
Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

const largestOfFour = (arr) => {
const maxArray = [];
for (let i= 0 ; i < arr.length ; i++){
const max = Math.max(...arr[i])
maxArray.push(max)
}
return maxArray
}

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
```

```
Repeat a given string str (first argument) for num times (second argument). Return an empty string if num is not a positive number. For the purpose of this challenge, do not use the built-in .repeat() method.

function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) {
  if (num <= 0) {
    return '';
  } else {
    let repeatedString = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
      repeatedString += str;
    }
    return repeatedString;
  }
}
```
