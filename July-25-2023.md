ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week such as videos and tables.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the HTML prework on Code Academy and reviwing Forms.

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field">
</form>
```

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish the course today.
