ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week such as videos and tables.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the HTML prework on Code Academy and reviewing Forms.

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field">
</form>
```

Adding a Label
. To associate a <label> and an <input>, the <input> needs an id attribute. We then assign the for attribute of the <label> element with the value of the id attribute of <input>, like so:

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
  <br>
  <input type="text" name="food" id="meal">
</form>
```
HTML FORMS
Range Input
Using an <input type="number"> is great if we want to allow users to type in any number of their choosing. But, if we wanted to limit what numbers our users could type we might consider using a different type value. Another option we could use is setting type to "range" which creates a slider.

To set the minimum and maximum values of the slider we assign values to the min and max attribute of the <input>. We could also control how smooth and fluid the slider works by assigning the step attribute a value. Smaller step values will make the slider move more fluidly, whereas larger step values will make the slider move more noticeably. Take a look at the code to create a slider:

```
<form>
  <label for="volume"> Volume Control</label>
  <input id="volume" name="volume" type="range" min="0" max="100" step="1">
</form>
```

The code above renders:rendered slider for volume control

In the example above, every time the slider moves by one, the value of the <input>â€˜s value attribute changes.ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish the course today.

Datalist Input
Even if we have an organized dropdown list, if the list has a lot of options, it could be tedious for users to scroll through the entire list to locate one option. Thatâ€™s where using the <datalist> element comes in handy.

The <datalist> is used with an <input type="text"> element. The <input> creates a text field that users can type into and filter options from the <datalist>. Letâ€™s go over a concrete example:

```
<form>
  <label for="city">Ideal city to visit?</label>
  <input type="text" list="cities" id="city" name="city">
 
  <datalist id="cities">
    <option value="New York City"></option>
    <option value="Tokyo"></option>
    <option value="Barcelona"></option>
    <option value="Mexico City"></option>
    <option value="Melbourne"></option>
    <option value="Other"></option>  
  </datalist>
</form>
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish the forms portion of the review today.
