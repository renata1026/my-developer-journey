ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week such as videos and tables.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the HTML prework on Code Academy and reviwing Forms.

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field">
</form>
```

Adding a Label
. To associate a <label> and an <input>, the <input> needs an id attribute. We then assign the for attribute of the <label> element with the value of the id attribute of <input>, like so:

```
<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <label for="meal">What do you want to eat?</label>
  <br>
  <input type="text" name="food" id="meal">
</form>
```

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish the course today.
