ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on problem/solving.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning about the DOM. Here is the exercise that I did https://dom-hack-my-head.netlify.app/.

```
These are the code war challenges
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

function numberToString(num) {
  // Return a string of the number here!
  return num.toString();
}

```
```
/* Totally Not Another FizzBuzz 

Scrimba CEO Per Borgen wants you to write a program to grant special bonuses to all his employees based on their employee ID numbers! 

Scrimba has 100 employees and their employee ID numbers range from 1 - 100. If the employee's ID number is: 

Divisible by 3 - Vacation! 
Divisible by 5 - $100,000 bonus! 
Divisible by both 3 and 5 - JACKPOT! 1 Million and a Yacht!
Not divisible by 3 or 5 - :(
    
Write a program to loop through all the ID numbers and print their prize. 
Your function's output should look something like this: 

1 - :(
2 - :(
3 - Vacation! 
4 - :(
5 - $100,000 bonus!

Hint: Remainder operator, modulo 
 */

function awardBonuses(){
    // loop through 1 - 100
    for(let i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
        // is divisible by 3 & 5? 
        if(i % 15 === 0){
            console.log(`${i} - JACKPOT! 1 Million and a Yacht!`);
        } else if(i % 3 === 0){
            console.log(`${i} - Vacation!`);
        } else if(i % 5 === 0){
            console.log(`${i} - $100,000 bonus!`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${i} - :(`);
        }
        
    }

}
```

```
Create a function that returns the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 positive integers. No floats or non-positive integers will be passed.

For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

function sumTwoSmallestNumbers(numbers) {
  // Sort the numbers array in ascending order
  const sortedNumbers = numbers.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b);

  // Get the two smallest numbers
  const minNum1 = sortedNumbers[0];
  const minNum2 = sortedNumbers[1];

  // Return the sum of the two smallest numbers
  return minNum1 + minNum2;
}

const numbers = [5, 10, 2, 8, 3];
const result = sumTwoSmallestNumbers(numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 5 (smallest) + 2 (second smallest) = 7
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to complete this project for today and to review event listening for tomorrow's lecture.
