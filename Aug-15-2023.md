ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on problem/solving.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning about the DOM. Here is the exercise that I did https://dom-hack-my-head.netlify.app/.

```
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

Examples (input --> output):
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"

function numberToString(num) {
  // Return a string of the number here!
  return num.toString();
}

```

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to complete this project for today and to review event listening for tomorrow's lecture.
