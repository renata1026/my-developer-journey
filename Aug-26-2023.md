Yesterday, I did a React project https://github.com/renata1026/hungry-pets where we need to feed the pets. 

ðŸ“– Currently, I completed the hungry pets program https://hungry-pets-hack-my-head.netlify.app/  This project specs include:
You can see a picture of a pet and their level of hunger. You are able to "feed" your pet and its hunger goes down. Every second the hunger of your pet increases. If a pet reaches a certain hunger, it dies.


```

Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non negative numbers and returns it as a result.

The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

Examples:

function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  return [...new Set(arr)];
}

const originalArray = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5];
const uniqueArray = removeDuplicates(originalArray);
console.log(uniqueArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


Input -> Output
[1, 1, 2] -> [1, 2]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2] -> [1, 2, 3]

function distinct(a) {
   const myArray = [];
   for (let item of a) {
      if (!myArray.includes(item)) {
         myArray.push(item)
      }
   }
   console.log(myArray) 
}

distinct([1, 1, 2])
```
```
Very simple, given an integer or a floating-point number, find its opposite.

// Sum Numbers
function sum (numbers) {
    "use strict";
  
};
```
write me a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s.

the string should start with a 1.

a string with size 6 should return :'101010'.

with size 4 should return : '1010'.

with size 12 should return : '101010101010'.

The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.

```
function stringy (size) {
let myWordArray = [];
      for (let i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
         if (i%2 === 0) {
            myWordArray.push("0")
         }
         else myWordArray.push("1")
      }
      return myWordArray.join("")
} 

stringy(6)
```
```
Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers.

Return your answer as a number.

function sumMix(x){
 let sum = 0;
 for( element of x) {
   sum += parseInt(element)
 }
  return sum
}
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to do mobile responsiveness and a few codewards challenges.
