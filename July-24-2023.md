ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on Grokking the Coding Interview and learning patterns

ðŸ“– Currently, I am doing an HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week. 
Some things to remember are:

Videos
In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> element, the <video> element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <img> element however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tags
```
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
```
The opening and closing head tags typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag:

<head>
</head>

A browserâ€™s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>
```
HTML TABLES
Table Headings
Table data doesnâ€™t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.

The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Spanning Columns
What if the table contains data that spans multiple columns?

For example, a personal calendar could have events that span across multiple hours, or even multiple days.

Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The attribute accepts an integer (greater than or equal to 1) to denote the number of columns it spans across.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Monday</th>
    <th>Tuesday</th>
    <th>Wednesday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Out of Town</td>
    <td>Back in Town</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

My goal is to finish 1/3 of the course today.
