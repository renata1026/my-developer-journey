ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on Grokking the Coding Interview and learning patterns

ðŸ“– Currently, I am doing an HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week. 
Some things to remember are:

Videos
In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> element, the <video> element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <img> element however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tags
```
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
```
The opening and closing head tags typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag:

<head>
</head>

A browserâ€™s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>
```
HTML TABLES
Table Headings
Table data doesnâ€™t make much sense without titles to describe what the data represents.

To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: <th>.

The table heading element is used just like a table data element, except with a relevant title. Just like table data, a table heading must be placed within a table row.

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
    <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">Temperature</th>
    <td>73</td>
    <td>81</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

My goal is to finish 1/3 of the course today.
