ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on Grokking the Coding Interview and learning patterns

ðŸ“– Currently, I am doing an HTML prework on Code Academy in preparation for my full stack bootcamp next week. 
Some things to remember are:

Videos
In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos. Like the <img> element, the <video> element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. Unlike the <img> element however, the <video> element requires an opening and a closing tags
```
<video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported
</video>
```
My goal is to finish 1/3 of the course today.
