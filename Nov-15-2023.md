ðŸ“– Yesterday, I completed some codewars questions. 
I watched the Next-Auth App Router video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md65iBX5Gxg


ðŸ’» Today, I did codewar problems. 
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

```
function rowSumOddNumbers(n) {
    return Math.pow(n, 3);
}

```
ðŸŽ¯ Later I will be continuing with Joy of React Module 2.
