ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did 5 code war problems and a Next.Js tutorial

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.
```
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

function disemvowel(str) {
  let vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u','A','E','I','O','U']
  let array = str.split('').filter((char)=> !vowels.includes(char)).join('');
  return array;
}

```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
