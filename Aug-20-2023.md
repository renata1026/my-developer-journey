Yesterday, I built a project called Farm Game https://farm-hack-my-head.netlify.app/ It involved using pure Vanilla Javascript building elements and a lot of logic. 
Creating an array and pushing data into this array. Also adding counters for the score and so forth. I am happy with this litle project and the design and plan on 
expanding on it later. 

ðŸ“– Currently, I am reading the react documentation https://react.dev/learn to prepare for our course tomorrow that will focus on react. 

 ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to continue going through react docs and may do a Scrimba React module tonight.
