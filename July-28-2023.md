💻 Yesterday, I reviewed React passing props, mapping, and destructuring.

📖 Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.
Task
Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

```
function minMax(arr){
  return [Math.min(...arr) , Math.max(...arr)]; 
``
Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.
```
function maps(x){
return x.map((square) => (square * 2))
}
```
🎯 My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
