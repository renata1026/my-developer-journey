ðŸ“– Yesterday, I completed some codewars questions. 
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.: (Input --> Output)

```
function rowSumOddNumbers(n) {
    return Math.pow(n, 3);
}

```

ðŸ’» Today, I met with my partner and we completed the register page on the front end. We also created an action server component and authorization for the login and
register page using Next/Auth.
I then did the Module 2 exercises from Joy of React which had exercises of Form Binding.
This code is written in JavaScript and appears to be using the Object.keys() method to iterate over the keys of an object referred to as COUNTRIES.
The code then maps over these keys to generate an array of <option> elements for a dropdown list in HTML.

```
          {Object.keys(COUNTRIES).map(
            (key) => (
              <option key={key} value={key}>
                {COUNTRIES[key]}
              </option>
            )
          )}

```
ðŸŽ¯ Later I will be doing some codewars.
