Yesterday, I deployed a my fullstack bootcamp wikipedia clone (https://wikipedia-hackmyhead.netlify.app/)

ðŸ“– Currently, I have reviewed Javascript basics such as variable, type conversion, string, strict equality, spread, slice, not operator, arithimic expressions, math methods, and if statements.
```
Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.

function factorialize(num) {
  let product = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    product *= i;
  }
  return product;
}

factorialize(5);
```


ðŸŽ¯ My goal today is to do Free Code Camps ES6 and 3 beginner Algorithim questions.
