Yesterday, I did a JS tutorial we reviewed in our lesson what is javascript, how to add a script tag, and using let or const to declare variables. For our assignment I created an ASCII art so people could ask "What animal is this?": https://animal-art.netlify.app/

ðŸ“– Currently, we reviewed While Loops and For Loops.Specs:
```
Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
let i = 5;

while (i >= 0) {
myArray.push(i)
i--

}
```
Iterate with JavaScript For Loops
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

You are going to create a web app which will perform different operations based on what the user requests such as in this application https://hmh-demos.netlify.app/day-6/Links to an external site.. The following user requests are possible:

yell: Converts the word to be all uppercase.
length: Calculates the number of characters in a string WITHOUT using the built-in length method.
binary: Filters the word for only occurrences of 0 or 1.
The app tells the user all the possible functions it can run.
The app tells the user if it does not recognize a command.
```
Use a for loop to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
  myArray.push(i)
}
```

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish reviewing functions and review while loops and for loops on FreeCodeCamp.
