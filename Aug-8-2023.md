Yesterday, I did a JS tutorial we reviewed in our lesson what is javascript, how to add a script tag, and using let or const to declare variables. For our assignment I created an ASCII art so people could ask "What animal is this?": https://animal-art.netlify.app/

ðŸ“– Currently, we reviewed While Loops and For Loops.Specs:
```
Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
let i = 5;

while (i >= 0) {
myArray.push(i)
i--

}
```

You are going to create a web app which will perform different operations based on what the user requests such as in this application https://hmh-demos.netlify.app/day-6/Links to an external site.. The following user requests are possible:

yell: Converts the word to be all uppercase.
length: Calculates the number of characters in a string WITHOUT using the built-in length method.
binary: Filters the word for only occurrences of 0 or 1.
The app tells the user all the possible functions it can run.
The app tells the user if it does not recognize a command.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish reviewing functions and review while loops and for loops on FreeCodeCamp.
