ðŸ’» Yesterday, I am watching a PRISMA tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebA5J-rlwg&t=15s

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the backend for project spammer. I created the server with Express and database using Coachroach.db 

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to connect my front end for project spammer to my backend. I also am doing a few codewars problems.
