ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did code wars and a Next.Js tutorial on google cloud and next authorization.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.
Find the smallest integer in the array
```
  function findSmallestInt(args) {
    return Math.min(...args)
  }

```
```
const stray = numbers => numbers.find(num => numbers.indexOf(num) === numbers.lastIndexOf(num));
```
const stray = numbers => ...: This line defines an arrow function called stray that takes an array numbers as its input. Arrow functions are a concise way of writing functions in JavaScript.

numbers.find(num => numbers.indexOf(num) === numbers.lastIndexOf(num)): This is the core of the function, where the find method is used to search for the element that meets a certain condition.

numbers.indexOf(num): This part finds the first occurrence (index) of the current element num in the array numbers.
numbers.lastIndexOf(num): This part finds the last occurrence (index) of the current element num in the array numbers.
The condition numbers.indexOf(num) === numbers.lastIndexOf(num) checks if the first occurrence index and the last occurrence index of the current element are the same. If this condition is true, it means that the element appears only once in the array.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.

Input

Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output

Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example
input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

```function openOrSenior(data){
  // ...
  //if(senior >= 55 && handicap > 7 )
  let people = data.map((person)=>(
  person[0] >= 55 && person[1] > 7 ? 'Senior':'Open'
  ))
  return people;
}
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
