Yesterday, I read some of the React documentions https://react.dev/learn and recreated a react project in javascript https://js-to-react.netlify.app/. 

📖 Currently, I am doing the DOM project but recreating it in React.

🎯 My goal is to review the project one more time with creating react components and remembering when to add UseState, UseEffect also will do 
preparation work for tomorrow which includes:
