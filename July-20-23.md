ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did code wars and a Next.Js tutorial on google cloud and next authorization.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.
Find the smallest integer in the array
```
  function findSmallestInt(args) {
    return Math.min(...args)
  }

```

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
