ðŸ’» Yesterday, I am watching a PRISMA tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebA5J-rlwg&t=15s

ðŸ“– Currently, I am completing the backend for project spammer. I created the server with Express and database using coachroachdb 

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to connect my front end for project spammer to my backend. I also am doing a few codewars problems. 

You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

```
const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
  let shouldReturn = distanceToPump - (mpg * fuelLeft)
  if(shouldReturn <= 0){
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
  
};
```
Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.
```
function getAge(inputString){
let split = inputString.split('') 
let firstCharacter = parseInt(inputString[0])

let age = 0
if (age >= 0 && age <= 9){
  return firstCharacter
}

}
```
