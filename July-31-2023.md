 Yesterday, I am learning/working on reviewing React and building a meme generator.

ðŸ“– Currently, I deployed a fansite for my fullstack bootcamp https://doctor-strange-hackmyhead.netlify.app/

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to do the prework for class tomorrow which is to watch CSS Basics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3iEE29ZXRM&feature=youtu.be and CSS box model https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIO5326FgPE and will do 2 codewar problems tonight.
