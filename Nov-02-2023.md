ðŸ“– Yesterday, I worked on codewars problems. 

ðŸ’» Today, my teammate and I created a Next.js file and converted our front end application into Next.js from React. 

ðŸŽ¯ Later, I am doing more Codewars problems. 

How to find the max number
```
function findMaxNumber(arr) {
  // Declare a variable to store the maximum number. We can initialize it to the first element in the array
  let max = arr[0];

  // Loop through the array starting at the second element. We start at the second element because we already set the maximum number to the first element
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // If the current element is greater than the maximum number, set the maximum number to the current element
    if (arr[i] > max) {
      max = arr[i];
    }
  }

  // Return the maximum number
  return max;
}
```
In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

```
function highAndLow(numbers){
  numbers = numbers.split(' ');
  return `${Math.max(...numbers)} ${Math.min(...numbers)}`;
}
```
