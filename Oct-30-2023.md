💻 Yesterday, I  studied Joy of React Course I aim to complete conditional rendering of Module 1 reviewed, components, props, fragments, and iteration as well as watched a 
tutorial on Stripe integration.

📖 Currently, my teammate and I created a schema for a job-board project https://github.com/jobi-job-board/job-board-server. 

🎯 I did a codewars problem 

Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single one. The arrays only contain integers. Also, the final outcome must be sorted and not have any duplicate.

```
function mergeArrays(a, b) {
  let mergedArrays = [...a,...b]
  mergedArrays = [...new Set(mergedArrays)]
  mergedArrays.sort((a,b)=> a - b);
  return mergedArrays
     
  }
```
