Yesterday, I did a React project https://github.com/renata1026/hungry-pets where we need to feed the pets. 

ðŸ“– Currently, I completed the hungry pets program https://hungry-pets-hack-my-head.netlify.app/  This project specs include:
You can see a picture of a pet and their level of hunger. You are able to "feed" your pet and its hunger goes down. Every second the hunger of your pet increases. If a pet reaches a certain hunger, it dies.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to do mobile responsiveness and a few codewards challenges.

```

Define a function that removes duplicates from an array of non negative numbers and returns it as a result.

The order of the sequence has to stay the same.

Examples:

Input -> Output
[1, 1, 2] -> [1, 2]
[1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2] -> [1, 2, 3]

function distinct(a) {
   const myArray = [];
   for (let item of a) {
      if (!myArray.includes(item)) {
         myArray.push(item)
      }
   }
   console.log(myArray) 
}

distinct([1, 1, 2])

```
