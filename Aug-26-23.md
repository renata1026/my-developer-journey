Yesterday, I did a React project https://github.com/renata1026/hungry-pets where we need to feed the pets. 

📖 Currently, I completed the hungry pets program https://hungry-pets-hack-my-head.netlify.app/  This project specs include:
You can see a picture of a pet and their level of hunger. You are able to "feed" your pet and its hunger goes down. Every second the hunger of your pet increases. If a pet reaches a certain hunger, it dies.

🎯 My goal is to complete my hungry pets project by Sunday.
