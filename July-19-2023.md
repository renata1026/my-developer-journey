ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did 5 code war problems and a Next.Js tutorial

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.
```
Transposing Two Strings - using a for loop will give you two vertical strings

H W
e o
l r
l l
o d

const transposeTwoStrings = arr => {
  const max = Math.max(arr[0].length, arr[1].length)
  let result = []
  
  for(let i = 0; i < max; i++){
    result.push(`${arr[0][i] || ' '} ${arr[1][i] || ' '}`)
  }
  
  return result.join('\n')
}
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
