Yesterday, I did an Event Listener Project https://js-to-react-part-two.netlify.app/

📖 Currently, I am doing a React project where we need to feed the pets. 
This project specs include:

You can see a picture of a pet and their level of hunger.
You are able to "feed" your pet and its hunger goes down.
Every second the hunger of your pet increases.
If a pet reaches a certain hunger, it dies.


🎯 My goal is to complete my hungry pets project by Sunday.
