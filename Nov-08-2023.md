ðŸ“– Yesterday, on a udemy course called 70+ JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures & Algorithms. 

ðŸ’» Today, I worked with my team member on the backend of our job board app. https://github.com/jobi-job-board/job-board
We also solved a codewars problem together. 

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

```
function filter_list(list) {
  // Return a new array with the strings filtered out
  return list.filter((item)=> typeof item === 'number' );
}
```
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

```
function friend(friends){
  return friends.filter((friend)=>friend.length === 4) 
              
          
}
```

ðŸŽ¯ Later, I will be looking at module 2 of joy of react.
