Yesterday, I did a React project https://github.com/renata1026/hungry-pets where we need to feed the pets.I completed the hungry pets program https://hungry-pets-hack-my-head.netlify.app/ This project specs include: You can see a picture of a pet and their level of hunger. You are able to "feed" your pet and its hunger goes down. Every second the hunger of your pet increases. If a pet reaches a certain hunger, it dies.

ðŸ“– Currently, I prepared for REST APIs and watched tutuorials to learn more. I learned that REST stands for Representation State Transfer as well as CRUD (create, read,update, delete). I also did a React Tutorial on Scrimba to review Props and Mapping. 

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to review some data and algorithim questions. 
```
Challenge 2:
Given an array of strings, return an array where 
the first letter of each string is capitalized
*/

const names = ["alice", "bob", "charlie", "danielle"]
// -->        ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Danielle"]
// Your code here


const array = names.map((name) => name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1));

console.log(array);


```
