ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on integrating stripe and watched this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKWJFpZYVAQ&t=1518s on my makeup ecommerce store. I also rebuilt my react app using vite.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am still completing Josh Comeau's Joy of React Module 1. I reviewed, components, props, fragments, and iteration.
