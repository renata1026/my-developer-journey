ðŸ“– Yesterday, I completed some codewars questions and reviewed props from Joy of React. 

ðŸ’» Today, I met with my partner and we completed the register page on the front end. We also created an action server component and authoriz
I then did the Module 2 exercises from Joy of React which had exercises of Form Binding.
This code is written in JavaScript and appears to be using the Object.keys() method to iterate over the keys of an object referred to as COUNTRIES.
The code then maps over these keys to generate an array of <option> elements for a dropdown list in HTML.

```
function century(year) {
  // Check if the year is divisible by 100
  let century = Math.ceil(year / 100);

  return century;
}

```
ðŸŽ¯ Later I will be doing some codewars.
