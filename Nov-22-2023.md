ðŸ“– Yesterday, I completed some codewars questions and reviewed props from Joy of React. 

ðŸ’» Today, I completed the login page of our Next.js app. 
I then did some codewars. 
Task
Given a year, return the century it is in.
```
function century(year) {
  // Check if the year is divisible by 100
  let century = Math.ceil(year / 100);

  return century;
}

```
ðŸŽ¯ Later I will be doing some codewars and plan to complete Module 2 of joy of react.
