ðŸ’» Yesterday, I worked on mock tech challenge questions and problem solving.

ðŸ“– Currently, I am working on Grokking the Coding Interview and learning patterns

Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums= [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false  
Explanation: There are no duplicates in the given array.
```
class Solution {
  containsDuplicate(nums) {
    let filteredArray = nums.filter((value, index) => nums.indexOf(value) === index);

    // Check if the filteredArray has a different length than the original nums array
    // If yes, then duplicates were removed, and the original array had duplicates.
    return filteredArray.length !== nums.length;
  }
}
```
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish an algorithim question today.
