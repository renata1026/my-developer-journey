ðŸ’» Yesterday, I completed my backend Project which included creating an Emoji server and testing GET, POST, PUT, and delete requests.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to complete project tonight and some codewars problems. 

``` Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
const removeFirst = str.slice(1,-1)
return removeFirst

};

```
