🎯 My goal is to complete project tonight and some codewars problems. 

Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

```
function removeChar(str){
const removeFirst = str.slice(1,-1)
return removeFirst

};

```

To return the two distinct highest values in a list. If there're less than 2 unique values, return as many of them, as possible.

The result should also be ordered from highest to lowest.
Sorts form highest to lowest then ....new Set takes out the duplicates
The slice(0, 2) method is used to extract the first two elements from the sorted array, which represent the two 

```
function twoHighest(arr) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  return [...new Set(arr)].slice(0, 2);
}
```
