ðŸ’» Yesterday, I did 5 code war problems and a Next.Js tutorial

ðŸ“– Currently, I am learning/working on problem solving.

Transposing Two Strings - using a for loop will give you two vertical strings

H W
e o
l r
l l
o d
Using - Math.max(arrayOne(0).length, arrayOne(1).length, arrayOne(2).length) will find the longest string in an array of strings

'\n' is passed as an argument to the join() method. This specifies that the newline character (\n) should be used as the separator between each element when joining them into a single string.


const transposeTwoStrings = arr => {
  const max = Math.max(arr[0].length, arr[1].length)
  let result = []
  
  for(let i = 0; i < max; i++){
    result.push(`${arr[0][i] || ' '} ${arr[1][i] || ' '}`)
  }
  
  return result.join('\n')
}
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to finish a few codewar problems by today
